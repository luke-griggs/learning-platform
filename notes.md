We're trying to reshape the learning experience

## The World: A Spatial Learning Environment

The platform is not just a tool—it's a place, a world where all your ideas, learnings, and subjects exist physically. You can move around in this space.

### Core Concept

- A large square represents the world
- A dot represents you as a person
- WASD keyboard controls for movement
- Topics are represented as **trees in a forest**
- Related ideas are connected by visible **trails**
- Trees grow taller/fuller as you engage more with that topic

### Subject Squares

Each broad subject area (math, history, biology, etc.) is its own discrete square/world. Visual themes per subject while staying minimal and abstract. For example:

- **Math**: crystalline, geometric
- **Biology**: organic curves
- **History**: angular, architectural

**Navigation between squares:**
- Map overlay in top left corner—click to enlarge, shows all squares, click to teleport
- Can also walk to the edge of a square where a button transitions you to the adjacent area

**Onboarding:**
- First visit: choose from a list of broad subject areas
- Once selected: blank slate forest to begin planting

### Trees (Topics)

Each topic you learn is a tree. Click into a tree and the world fades out, replaced by a full-screen interface containing:

- List of past conversations (not one continuous chat)
- "New Chat" button to start a new conversation
- Exercises related to that topic
- Doorways/links to related topics (other trees)

**Topic arrangement:**
- System arranges similar topics near each other
- Trails visibly connect related ideas across the forest
- Underlying graph structure tracks connections (even across different subject squares)

### Creating New Topics (Orbs)

- "New Topic" button in the interface
- An orb appears attached to your character
- Walk around the forest and place it where you want
- Orb becomes a seedling, then grows into a tree as you engage with it

### The AI Companion

A wisp or small companion that physically follows you through the world.

- Click on it: a smaller chat pops out to the side (doesn't block the screen)
- Can ask quick questions from anywhere in the world
- Provides suggestions on what to explore next
- Customizable appearance
- Acts as a guide on your learning journey

Because of the underlying graph connecting all ideas, the companion can reference related topics you've explored—even across different subject squares.

## Original Notes

I'm using my conversations with Claude as a reference point

some things that I would change if I could
- I'd like the model to ask me more questions that make me think deeply
- For technical conversations I'd like supplementary math/coding questions
- Go down a quick rabbit hole then return back to where I was
- "here's how this relates to this other thing"
- Robust tracking of my understanding
- Knowing the books that I read
- Ability to upload materials

- If a conversation covers multiple subject areas, there should be connections between them

- helper in a sidebar for me to ask quick questions

- Initial interface is just a voice input 
- Journal associated with that topic that contains transcripts/typed explanations

- general memory and memory for each umbrella topic

- some sort of progress tracking


I like the idea of having things separated into practice and topics, with topics being a place where all of your conversations are stored. Essentially, what a typical LLM interface looks like, where we have the message history for all the different chats. The exercise tab would essentially be a place where you'd be practicing things like using equations, programming (if the idea relates to programming), or just the applications of what you're learning.

Perhaps as a way to keep things centralized, the core part of the platform could be a sort of canvas where people can upload materials, notes, images. There can also be an LLM within the actual canvas as well that they can use to ask questions @canvas.png




A. Verbal explanation (spoken aloud)

Explain the concept out loud, as if teaching someone
Record yourself (audio or video)
Notice where you stumble or say "um" - those are conceptual gaps

Why: Forces linear, coherent articulation. You can't skip steps when speaking.
B. Visual diagram (drawn from memory)

Draw the concept without references
Use boxes, arrows, hierarchies, whatever makes sense
Label relationships, not just components

Why: Forces structural understanding. Exposes how components relate spatially/temporally.
C. Written explanation (typed/handwritten)

Write out the explanation in prose
Try to make it as clear and precise as possible
Use specific examples

Why: Writing allows more careful word choice than speaking. You can refine as you go.
D. Physical gesture/metaphor

Use hand movements to explain the concept
Embody the mechanism physically
Create a spatial metaphor with your body

Why: Engages sensorimotor systems. Particularly powerful for concepts involving movement, flow, or transformation.
E. Worked example (problem-solving)
Apply the concept to solve an actual problem
Work through the steps manually
Show your work
